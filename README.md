# DataPaginationandFiltering

### Project 2 - Creating a Show Page with data pagination and filtering


#### For this project, I have created a page that displays 9 students from a list, with corresponding pagination.
####  For the pagination, the buttons have an active class and are set to dark blue when clicked.

#### I have also added some additional features, such as:
*  An search bar with CSS;
*  Functionality to the Search bar to allow user to search for students name and last name;
*  A message if no results are found.

##### I have coded freely, using and testing different methods until all features worked well. 
###### The code is commented to explain the steps and functions.

### Instructions:
#### Just open index.html in your favorite browser
